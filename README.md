# Simple Calculator

This is a simple calculator built using React.js with a Vite framework. The logic revolves around using two useState() variables to store two number variables and be able to perform basic mathematical operations. There is a third useState() variable to handle the screen and display values after certain buttonClicks are performed by the user.

useState() Variables
- setNumber1()
- setNumber2()
- setScreen()
